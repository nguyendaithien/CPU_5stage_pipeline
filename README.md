Description: This project implements and optimizes the IBEX core with a 5-stage pipeline.

<span style="font-size: 120 px;">**Features**</span>  
-Design Metrics: The pipeline architecture includes 5 stages: Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Instruction Execute, Instruction Memory, and Instruction Writeback.

-Verification Method: A constrained-random verification environment is created to generate stimuli for the DUT (Device Under Test) and develop test cases for the design.

-Synthesis: Synthesizing to a netlist and measuring power consumption.
